This project makes extensive use of the HGE engine:

At the time of writing, I utilize the assets coming with the framework:
Particles.png
Trail.psi

Starfield texture is a noise map made seamless.

Harmonic music coming from ijs.mtasa.com (Cecill Etheredge), sorry had to rip it
from SoundCloud, I'll make an effort to get the official version :)

Rest is mine.
