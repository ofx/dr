TODO:

- Fix memory leaks (the debug output on program termination will give some pointers)
- Increase performance of levelgrid implementation (deletion of a grid causes framedrops)
- Implement more weapons and bullets
- Currently ships with muParser, would be cool to build weapon and bullet generation based on this library
